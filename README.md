# story:
once apon a time, cool math games was blocked at my school. now im obviously a scratch person myself, but think about it: you might not be a fan of elvis, but if he died, you would feel kinda bad about it. so i made a google site where i would collect different games and fun sites and have them all conveniently available to everyone. then cool math games was unblocked and liked making the site too much to quit.
