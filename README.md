! everything in github.io has been catagorized as games on lightspeed filters and will be blocked on some devices, we are currently fixing the problem!
an online gaming collection, a work in progress. the google site is the original and current version. the github site will be ready soon.

# updates:
-all emulation now done on-site with ethanobrien's port of emulatorjs.\
-above allows a plethora of consoles to be playable.\
-all games are now zipped, slightly longer load times for smaller file size

# upcoming updates:
-increasing libraries for GB, GBC, and GBA.\
-adding a 'freeplay' mode: upload your own roms.

# ideas:
-set up a system for user to get any game off of vimm's lair (if its unblocked for them).

# story:
once apon a time, cool math games was blocked at my school. now im obviously a scratch person myself, but think about it: you might not be a fan of elvis, but if he died, you would feel kinda bad about it. so i made a google site where i would collect different games and fun sites and have them all conveniently available to everyone. then cool math games was unblocked and liked making the site too much to quit.
