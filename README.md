![Site Logo](https://github.com/teddblue/gamebois/blob/main/imageAssets/gameboislogo512.gif)

an online gaming collection, a work in progress. the google site is the original and current version. the github site will be ready soon.

# updates:
-clicking the GBA will send you to the gamebois google site.\
-clicking the GB or GBC will send you to the GB or GBC page, respectively.\
-images are now downloaded to the repository from libretro instead of a direct link.\
-GB/GBC emulation done on-site (special thanks to binjgb by binji).

# upcoming updates:
-increasing libraries for GB and GBC.\
-creating GBA library.

# ideas:
-set up a system for user to get any game off of vimm's lair (if its unblocked for them).\
-find a ds emulator that can run on my site.

# story:
once apon a time, cool math games was blocked at my school. now im obviously a scratch person myself, but think about it: you might not be a fan of elvis, but if he died, you would feel kinda bad about it. so i made a google site where i would collect different games and fun sites and have them all conveniently available to everyone. then cool math games was unblocked and liked making the site too much to quit.
