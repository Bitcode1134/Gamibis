# gamebois
an online gaming collection, a work in progress. the google site is the original and current version. the github site will be ready soon.

# story:
once apon a time, cool math games was blocked at my school. now im obviously a scratch person myself, but think about it: you might not be a fan of elvis, but if he died, you would feel kinda bad about it. so i made a google site where i would collect different games and fun sites and have them all conveniently available to everyone. then cool math games was unblocked and  liked making the site too much to quit.

# here are the links:
github version (work in progress): https://teddblue.github.io/gamebois/
google sites version (current supported version): https://sites.google.com/view/game-bois/home
