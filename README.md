# gamebois
![Site Logo](https://github.com/teddblue/gamebois/blob/main/imageAssets/gameboislogo512.gif)

an online gaming collection, a work in progress. the google site is the original and current version. the github site will be ready soon.

# updates:
-home screen with console select (images by me).\
-clicking the GBA NES or SNES will send you to the gamebois google site.\
-clicking the GB will send you to the GB page, with a link to an emulator and a download for tetris.\
-using libretro cover art index for images.\

# upcoming updates:
-attempt to get the downloads linked to vimm's lair so my site isnt a rom site.\

# ideas:
-set up a system for user to get any game off of vimm's lair (if its unblocked for them).\
-have emulators housed on-site instead of opening on a new tab.\

# story:
once apon a time, cool math games was blocked at my school. now im obviously a scratch person myself, but think about it: you might not be a fan of elvis, but if he died, you would feel kinda bad about it. so i made a google site where i would collect different games and fun sites and have them all conveniently available to everyone. then cool math games was unblocked and liked making the site too much to quit.
